## TRS-40

### Concept

The TRS40 series is based on the same concepts as the TRS60, just 20% or so smaller. To accommodate the smaller portions, the `Win` and `Menu` keys
had to be returned to the bottom row and their is no `Lock` key. The lack of number keys in a 40% design is pprobably the single most detractor for 
those dislike 40% layouts. To help alliviate this we created a companion numpad.

Unfortunately this design is a 1/3 key larger than many other 40% boards, like the JB40. This was done to accomodate a 1.25x Tab and Return keys.
