# Keyboards


## TRS-60

### Concept

The TRS60 design is driven by a small set of principles.

* Symmetry
* Customization

## TRS-40

### Concept

The TRS-40 series is based on the same concepts as the TRS60, just 20% smaller. To accommodate the smaller portions, the `Win` and `Menu` keys
had to be returned to the bottom row, and their is no dedicated `Lock` key. 

Unfortunately this design is a half key larger than many other 40% boards, like the JB40. This was done to accommodate 1.25x Tab and Return keys.

The lack of number keys is probably the biggest detractor for those who dislike 40% layouts. To help alleviate this we created a companion numpad
with a matching low-profile.
